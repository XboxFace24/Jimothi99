# Jimothi99
A "totally normal" chatbot.

Originally "Stop Copying Me!" before release, Jimothi99 is a chatbot that copies everything you type.

Available as a Python 3 script for any Python-supported OS, bash script for Linux and Mac, a C++ application for Windows, and a Windows Batch Script for Windows and DOS (maybe).

Btw, only the Python 3 and Windows C++ based versions have the !stop command to quit the program. In the Windows Batch Script or bash versions, just press Control+C.

I am not responsible if you smash your keyboard using this! Have fun!

Use this for whatever you want. I don't care.

Here's an example screenshot (you might need to zoom in to read the text in the command prompts):
