Note: This program is open source and free. If you paid for this, DEMAND A REFUND
IMMEDIATELY!!

Btw, only the Python 3 and C++ versions have the !stop command to quit the program. In the
Windows Batch Script and bash versions, just press Control+C.

Use this for whatever you want. I don't care.

To run the bash script version, just open the Bash Version directory inside the Jimothi99 directory
on the terminal, and then type "bash jimothi99.bash" without quotes.
