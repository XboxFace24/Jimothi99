Note: This program is open source and free. If you paid for this, DEMAND A REFUND
IMMEDIATELY!!

Btw, only the Python 3 version has the !stop command to quit the program. In the
Windows Batch Script version, just press Ctrl+C.

Use this for whatever you want. I don't care.

Changelog:
1.0.1: Made the !stop command in the Python version work regardless of whether it's uppercase or lowercase.
1.0.0: Initial release
